   Memory Access Module

The Memory Access Module (MAM) gives the host read and write access to a memory in the system.
Typical use cases include the initialization of a memory with a program, or the inspection of memory post-mortem or during run-control debugging.

The module is either connected to the system memory, other memory blocks
or the last level cache.

access may be required to be guarded by a run-control triggered forced
writeback if necessary.
