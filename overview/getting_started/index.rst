About Open SoC Debug
--------------------

Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) have become embedded deeply into our lives. Most
of the time we enjoy the way they serve their purpose without getting in
the way. Until they don't. In those moments, we as engineers are
reminded of the complex interplay between software and hardware in SoCs.
We might pose questions like "How does my software execute on the chip?"
or "Why is it showing this exact behavior?" To answer these questions we
need insight into the system that executes the software. We gain this
insight through the debug infrastructure integrated into the SoC.

Even though debug infrastructure is an essential part of any SoC design,
most people consider creating it more of a necessary chore than an
exciting endeavor. Therefore, most vendors today include debug
infrastructure that follows one of two major specifications: `ARM
CoreSight <http://www.arm.com/products/system-ip/debug-trace/>`__ and
`NEXUS 5001 <http://nexus5001.org/>`__ (officially called "IEEE-ISTO
5001"). Unfortunately, none of these specifications are fully open, they
cannot be used without any money involved.

The Open SoC Debug (OSD) specification was created to close this gap.
Three key messages guide its design.

-  **OSD is a truly open (source) specification.** Without any committee
   membership required or royalty fees to be payed, anyone can freely

   -  share and modify the specification itself, and
   -  create and distribute implementations of the specification for any
      purpose.

-  **OSD is for debugging and tracing.** A debugging infrastructure by
   itself is not a solution, but a toolbox providing the right tool for
   the task. Some bugs are best hunted using run-control debugging, some
   are better found using tracing. OSD supports both, enabling hardware
   and software developers to pick what's best for their needs.
-  **OSD provides the common and enables the special.** SoCs came to
   live because they allow reuse of components and specialization at the
   same time, letting hardware designers focus on the unique challenges
   without re-inventing the wheel. OSD follows this lead. Common IP
   blocks, interfaces and software tools can be re-used, and multiple
   extension vectors allow for easy customization where necessary.

Scope
-----

By implementing Open SoC Debug, a SoC gains the following features (to a
varying and implementation-defined degree).

-  Support for run-control debugging, i.e. setting breakpoints and
   watchpoints and reading register values. In short, all you need to
   attach a debugger like GDB to the SoC.
-  Support for tracing, i.e. non-intrusively observing the program
   execution on the SoC.
-  Support for remotely controlling the SoC during development, e.g.
   starting the CPUs, resetting the system, and reading and writing the
   memories.

To provide these features, this specification defines

-  an extensible debug system architecture, covering both hardware and
   host software,
-  templates with well-defined interfaces for debug and trace IP blocks
   ("debug modules"),
-  a set of common debug modules for the most frequent run-control debug
   and tracing tasks,
-  a host-side software programming interface (API) for debug tools to
   interact with an OSD-enabled debug system.

In addition, implementations of many components described in the OSD
specification are made available under a permissive open source license
which can be used directly in custom designs.

Current Status
--------------

OSD is an evolving effort. Currently, we target the first release of the
base specification and module specification, that contain the following
parts:

-  Basic interfaces and transport protocols
-  A generic and mandatory memory map for all debug modules to allow
   enumeration, capabilities and versioning
-  Basic modules for run-control and trace debugging

This is just the start that covers the very basic functionality, but
more features are planned to be added to the specification in the near
future: tracing to memory instead of host, device traces, module
triggering, cross-triggers, on-chip aggregation and filtering,
sophisticated interconnects, just to mention a few.

High-Level Features
===================

By implementing OSD, a SoC can easily be enhanced with advanced debug
functionality. This section describes these features in more detail.

Run-Control Debug
-----------------

Run-control debugging, a.k.a. breakpoint debugging, "stop-and-stare"
debugging, or just "debugging," is the most common way of finding
problems in software at early stages of development. Using software
tools like the GNU Debugger (gdb) breakpoints can be set in the software
code. If this point in the program reached, the program execution is
stalled and the program control is handed over to the debugger. Using
the debugger, a developer can now read register or memory values, print
stack traces, and much more. To be efficient, run-control debugging
functionality needs hardware support to stop the program execution at a
given time. In addition, run-control debugging on SoC platforms is
usually done remotely, i.e. the system is controlled from a host PC, as
opposed to running the debugger directly on the SoC.

OSD contains all parts to add run-control debug support to a SoC. On the
hardware side, OSD interfaces with the CPU core(s) to control its
behavior. On the host side, OSD provides a daemon that GDB can connect
to. The actual debugging is then handled by GDB and the usage of OSD is
transparent to the software developer.

Tracing
-------

Today's heterogeneous multi-core designs present new challenges to
software developers. Concurrent software distributed across multiple
CPUs and hardware accelerators, interacting with complex I/O interfaces
and strict real-time requirements is the new normal. This results in new
classes of bugs which are hard to find, like race conditions, deadlocks,
and severely degraded performance for no obvious reason. To find such
bugs, run-control debugging is not applicable: setting a breakpoint
disturbs the temporal relationship between the different threads of
execution. This disturbance to the program execution is called "probe
effect" and can cause the original problem to disappear when searching
for it, a phenomenon known as "Heisenbug."

Tracing avoids these problems by unobtrusively monitoring the program
execution and transferring the observations off-chip. There, the program
flow can be reconstructed and the program behavior analyzed.

OSD comes with components to enable tracing for not only CPU cores, but
also for any component in the SoC, such as memories, hardware
accelerators, and interconnects.

Memory Access
-------------

Reading and writing memories is an essential tool during bring-up and
debugging of a SoC. A typical use case is to write software to a program
memory from the host PC, to avoid writing it for example to a SD card or
flash memory and then resetting the system.

OSD ships with a module that can be attached to a memory to support
reads and writes from and to memories.

System Discovery
----------------

Users of today's debug systems know the pain: setting up a debugger on a
host PC to communicate with the hardware often requires obscure
configuration settings, secret switches and a bit of magic sauce to make
it all work.

OSD is designed to be plug-and-play. All hardware components are
self-describing. When a host connects to the system, it first enumerates
all available components, and reads necessary configuration bits.

Timestamping
------------

Timestamps are monotonically increasing numbers which are attached to
events generated by the debug system. (They usually do not correspond in
any way to wall-clock time.) Timestamps enable correlation of events in
different parts of the chip with each other. Additionally, they can be
used to restore order to events which are (for some reason) out of order
when they arrive.

While timestamps are useful in many cases, adding them to all events
generated by the debug system can significantly increase the overhead of
such events.

Currently OSD supports timestamps which are full numbers of configurable
width. Some debug modules can be configured to enable or disable
timestamp generation.

The timestamping method used in OSD is referred to as "source
timestamps" in some debug systems. Timestamps are added to the trace
data at the source, as opposed to (e.g.) adding timestamps when the data
is received by a debug adapter hardware between the SoC and the host PC.

Security and Authentication
---------------------------

Any debug system, by nature, exposes much of the system internals to the
outside world. To prevent abuse of the debug system, production devices
often require a developer to authenticate towards the system before
being able to use the debug system.

OSD provides the infrastructure to implement such features.

OSD By Example
==============

Before we dive into the details of the OSD architecture, this section
discusses two typical usage examples of OSD. The first example only
shows run-control debugging, the second one presents a full tracing
infrastructure.

OSD for Run-Control Debugging
-----------------------------

Many smaller single-core designs traditionally only support run-control
debugging through custom JTAG-based debug infrastructure. OSD supports
this use case well. Its modular architecture makes it easy to implement
only essential debug modules to support run-control debug, and to add
advanced features such as trace later without major changes.

.. figure:: img/overview_example_debug.*
   :alt: An example system using OSD for run-control debugging
   :name: fig:overview_example_debug

   An example system using OSD for run-control debugging

:numref:`Figure %s <fig:overview_example_debug>`
shows an example configuration of OSD for
a small run-control debug scenario. The functional system (to be
attached on the right side) consists of a single-core CPU, a memory and
a bus interconnect. To this functional system the debug modules are
attached.

-  The System Control Module (SCM) module allows to control the system
   remotely: reset the system, halt the system, reset the CPUs, etc.
-  The Core Debug Module (CDM) provides all functionality expected from
   a run-control debug system: setting breakpoints and reading CPU
   registers.
-  The Memory Access Module (MAM) gives access to the chip's memories
   for loading the memories during debugging (e.g. with the program
   code), to verify the memory contents, or to read out memory contents
   during debugging.
-  To show the benefits of using OSD, the example system adds another
   module, the Device Emulation Module UART (DEM-UART). This module
   behaves on the functional hardware side, and on the software side
   like a usual UART device. But instead of using dedicated pins, the
   data is transported through the debug connection.

For all mentioned components, OSD includes a full specifications which
enables a custom implementation, as well as a hardware implementation
that can be used unmodified or adapted to fit the interface to the
custom functional system.

The debug modules are all connected to a debug network. The OSD
specification does not require a specific network topology or
implementation type. However, usually OSD implementations use a 16-bit
wide, unidirectional ring network on chip (NoC), as it presents a good
trade-off between area usage and performance.

To connect with a host PC, three further components are needed: the Host
Interface Module (HIM) on the hardware side, a GLIP transport module,
and a software daemon on the host side.

The transport of data between host and device is handled by
`GLIP <http://glip.io>`__. GLIP is a library which abstracts the data
transport between hardware and software with a bi-directional FIFO
interface. The data transport itself can happen through different
physical interfaces, such as UART, JTAG, USB or PCI Express (PCIe). In
the presented example, a JTAG connection is used. A possibly existing
JTAG boundary scan interface can be re-used and a new Test Access Point
(TAP) is added to the JTAG chain for the debug connection.

The Host Interface Module (HIM) connects the debug network to the
FIFO-interface of GLIP.

On the software side, the OSD host daemon encapsulates the communication
to the device and provides a API for various tools communicating with
the debug system. A scriptable command line interface can be used to
control the system (such as reset, halt, etc.) and to read and write
memories. A gdb server provides an interface to the core debug
functionality that the GNU Debugger (gdb) can connect to. In the end,
software can be debugged with an unmodified gdb (and other gdb-enabled
IDEs, such as Eclipse CDT).

OSD for Tracing
---------------

Today's debug system architectures strictly separate between run-control
debugging and tracing. The example below shows how OSD units the two
worlds with a common interface, thus reducing development and
maintainance effort. Since most of the architecture is shared between
run-control debugging and tracing, upgrading an existing design from
run-control debugging to tracing is not a large step.

.. figure:: img/overview_example_trace.*
   :alt: An example system dual-core system using OSD tracing
   :name: fig:overview_example_trace

   An example system dual-core system using OSD tracing

:numref:`Figure %s <fig:overview_example_trace>` shows an example architecture of a OSD
system with tracing support for a dual-core design. Most of the
architecture is identical to the previous example: the host daemon, the
HIM, the debug network and the SCM, CDM and MAM debug modules. New in
this example are the following parts.

-  The GLIP transport library now uses USB 2.0 instead of JTAG for
   communication. This allows for higher off-chip transfer speeds to get
   improved visibility into the system by tracing.
-  The Core Trace Module (CTM) provides program trace (a.k.a.
   instruction trace) support. It is attached to the CPU core next to
   the CDM.
-  A graphical trace viewer can be attached to the host daemon to view
   the traces. Currently, OSD does not come with such a tool, but all
   interfaces are provided to easily write such a tool.

The two examples in this section have already shed a light on what is
possible with OSD. In the remainder of this document, we'll discuss OSD
in more depth, starting with a more general overview of the
architecture.

The Open SoC Debug Architecture
===============================

.. figure:: img/overview.*
   :alt: Debug System Overview
   :name: fig:overview

   Overview of an Open SoC Debug debug system

:numref:`Figure %s <fig:overview>` shows the different components in an Open SoC Debug-based
debug system.

-  **Debug modules** (shown on the right) monitor or interact with the
   functional components of the SoC. Towards the functional SoC the
   interface is implementation-specific. Towards the debug network the
   modules conform to a well-defined interface, consisting of two parts:
   a register-mapped control interface, and an event data interface
   (i.e. to send out trace data or other unsolicited messages).
-  The **debug network** is used to exchange messages between the debug
   modules and the host.
-  The **physical transport** connects the device to a host PC. For most
   implementations, we recommend using `GLIP <http://glip.io>`__.
-  On the host side, the **OSD host library** (``libopensocdebug``)
   provides a programming interface (API) to the debug system.
-  On top of that library, the **OSD daemon** (``opensocdebugd``) can be
   used to enable multiple debug tools to interact with the on-chip
   debug system.
-  Finally, **debug tools** use the debug system to perform debugging
   and analysis tasks, ranging from run-control debugging to tracing and
   runtime verification.

All parts of the OSD architecture have been designed with extensibility
in mind. But if no or only small customizations are needed, OSD also
includes default implementations of most components which can be used to
get a system up and running quickly.

Debug Modules
-------------

The debug modules either monitor a debug module or interact with it in
case of run-control debugging or special functionalities. On the other
side the debug modules generally interface the debug infrastructure via
the so called "Debug Interconnect Interface" (DII).

.. figure:: img/debug_module_generic_if.*
   :alt: Generic status and control interface
   :name: fig:debug_module_generic_if

   The generic status and control interface of all debug modules

All debug modules have a common debug-side status and control interface
as depicted in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:debug_module_generic_if>`.
It is a base register
map that contains mandatory and optional registers such as:

-  The *module class* and a module *vendor id* and *product id*, that
   support enumeration and software handling of the debug modules on the
   host
-  Enable and disable the entire module
-  Query module-specific capabilities and enable features

This interface usually runs in the debug system clock domain, while the
actual module logic is responsible for clock domain crossing between the
connected system component and the debug clock domain. Most simply,
tracing is usually done by (naturally) sampling the trace information in
the component's domain and cross the trace event via a small buffer into
the module logic that handles packetization of the trace event.

Register Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The host sends register access packets to the debug modules to

-  read and write control & status registers, or
-  access a debug module functionality

For example, the host can send a ``REQ_READ_REG`` packet to read module
version from the defined memory address ``MOD_VERSION (0x1)``. The
module will reply with a ``RESP_READ_REG`` containing the module
version.

It is generally allowed that debug modules can also generate such
request to query or control other debug modules.

Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) Bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: img/debug_module_mmiobridge.*
   :alt: The convenience MMIO bridge wrapper
   :name: fig:debug_module_mmiobridge

   The MMIO convenience wrapper.

OSD comes with convenience wrapper that maps the register access debug
packets to memory-mapped bus interface. As depicted in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig:debug_module_mmiobridge>` this module is especially useful for
host-controlled modules, such as run-control debugging.

The basic bus interface allows for register addresses. The data width is
configurable, for example as a processor's data width. The memory
addresses are register numbers, so that is is not possible to address
unaligned to the configured data width.

Finally, there is an ``interrupt`` signal that can be used to send
unsolicited events to the host, for example a ``breakpoint`` event. The
bridge is configured to read a value from a configured address and send
it to the host. Thereby it is possible to implement run-control
debugging without polling for events.

Debug Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debug events are unsolicited messages generated from a debug module.
This can for examle be a "breakpoint hit" message from a run-control
debug module, or a trace message. In the first case the host usually
starts with a sequence of register accesses, while in general debug
events are of a fire-and-forget nature.

Trace Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: img/generic_trace_module.*
   :alt: Generic trace module structure
   :name: fig:generic_trace_module

   Generic trace module structure

Trace modules have an overall structure as depicted in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig:generic_trace_module>`. Their task is to sample trace events
generated by the hardware. This trace events can be of arbitrary sizes,
but are usually constant at a single trace module's sampling interface.
Examples are:

-  A processor core's execution trace: Executed program counter,
   branch-taken or similar
-  A processor core's diagnosis trace: Functional unit utilization,
   branch predictor efficiency, etc.
-  Cache diagnosis trace: Hits/Misses, Conflicts, average memory access
   time, etc.
-  DMA controller trace: Start and end of request, average memory
   latency

Summarizing, nearly every hardware block is a candidate to generate
useful trace information.

Clock Domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The base functionality of a trace module is packetization of the trace
data to trace event packets. Optionally, the module may filter events or
compress the event stream. At some point it is necessary to cross
between the module's clock domain and the debug clock domain. This can
alternatively be done on the trace event sampling, at the packet output
or somewhere in between, depending on which clock is faster and at which
rates trace events are generated.

Overflow Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case the trace events are generated at a faster rate than the host
interface can transfer. This problem becomes crucial with the increasing
number of trace modules. Generally, this can be done on the level of the
debug system by a sophisticated flow control that will be specified in
later revisions. An overflow occurs if a trace event is generated, but
cannot be transferred or buffered due to backpressure from the
interconnect, but backpressure cannot be generated to the system module.
In the current specification the trace infrastructure detects this
situation, counts how many packets could not be transfered and then
transfers a ``missed_events`` event once it the interface is available
again.

Transport and Switching
-----------------------

To route debug information to the correct debug module and to the host,
OSD uses a simple packet-based protocol. The packet size is limited by
the implementation and can be queried from the *System Control Module
(SCM)*. The minimum value for the maximum packet size is 8.

The *Debug Interconnect Interface (DII)* defines the data format and
flow control mechanism. The packet width must be at least 16 bit and
currently is set fixed to 16 bit.

The debug packets contain the necessary routing and identification
information, namely the destination and the source, in their header,
which are the first two data items in a packet.

One key property of the transport & switching in the Open SoC Debug
specification is that it generally allows that debug modules exchange
packets between them. This enables on-chip trace processing, run-control
debugging from a special core or other methods to reduce the traffic on
the host interface, which is the most critical resource in modern
debugging.

.. figure:: img/interconnect.*
   :alt: Debug ring and other interconnects
   :name: fig:interconnect

   Debug ring and other interconnects

In general, the interconnect can have any possible topology as long as
it fulfills two basic properties: strict-ordering of packets with the
same ``(src,dest)`` tuple and deadlock-freedom. The first property does
forbid debug packets from one source to one destination to overtake each
other in the interconnect to allow payload data to span multiple
packets. @Fig:interconnect shows the favored topologies. The baseline
implementation is a simple ring interconnect. The ring balances well
between clock speed, required chip area and most importantly
flexibility. It can easily span the entire chip without dominating a
design.

Alternatively, other topologies may be favored. For example a low count
of debug modules favors a multiplexer interconnect. Especially if the
debug modules are all trace debugging or all run-control debugging a bus
or similar can be favorable for low debug module counts. When the
modules also communicate with each other a crossbar may be used for high
throughput, but with the disadvantage of large area overhead.

Finally, we believe once some first tests with larger systems in the
real world have been performed, hierarchical topologies may become
favorable. Beside optimizing the resource utilization, aggregating
modules may bridge subsets of trace modules to the actual debug
interconnect to perform size optimizations on the aggregated packet
stream.

Physical Interface
------------------

The physical interface is abstracted in Open SoC Debug as a FIFOs which
transmit data between the host and the device.

.. figure:: img/glip.*
   :alt: GLIP abstracts from the physical interface
   :name: fig:glip_overview

   GLIP as abstraction layer from the physical interface

While not required by OSD, we recommend building on top of
`GLIP <http://www.glip.io>`__ as depicted in @fig:glip\_overview. GLIP
provides a generic FIFO interface that reliably transfers data between
the host and the system. Multiple alternatives for simulations and
prototyping hardware exist. In a silicon device, a high-speed serial
interface is most probably favorable.

Host Software
-------------

As mentioned before, the host software is not in the focus of the Open
SoC Debug project, but we strongly support development of debug software
around our infrastructure.

The basic level of the ``libopensocdebug`` is the packetization of debug
packets. It also provides higher-level functions, for example register
access functions or up to convenience functions to perform
module-specific operations. A debug tool can build against this library,
or alternatively start the ``opensocdebugd`` daemon that allows
multiplexing of one Open SoC Debug-enabled system between different
tools.

Basic Debug Modules
===================

In the following we will shortly introduce the core group of debug
modules which are be part of Open SoC Debug. Only two modules are
mandatory: The *Host Interface Module* to transfer data between the
debug system and the host or memory, and the *System Control Module*
that identifies the system, provides system details and controls the
system.

Host Interface Module (HIM)
---------------------------

.. figure:: img/debug_module_him.*
   :alt: Host Interface Module
   :name: fig:debug_module_him

   Host Interface Module

The *Host Interface Module (HIM)* converts the debug packets to a
``length``-``value`` encoded data stream, that is transferred using the
glip interconnect. This format is simple and contains the length of the
debug packet in one data item followed by the debug packet.

Alternatively, the HIM can be configured to store the debug packets to
the system memory using the memory interface.

Host Authentication Module (HAM)
--------------------------------

.. figure:: img/debug_module_ham.*
   :alt: Host Authentication Module
   :name: fig:debug_module_ham

   Host Authentication Module

The system can require the host to authenticate before connecting to the
debug system, because the debug can expose confidential information. A
*HAM* implementation can for example require a token to match or a
sophisticated challenge-response protocol. If configured the
`HIM <#host-interface-module-him>`__ will wait for the HAM to allow the
host to communicate with modules other than the HAM.

System Control Module (SCM)
---------------------------

.. figure:: img/debug_module_scm.*
   :alt: System Control Module
   :name: fig:debug_module_scm

   System Control Module

The *System Control Module (SCM)* is always mapped to address ``1`` on
the debug interconnect (``0`` is the host/HIM address). The host first
queries the SCM to provide system information, like a system identifier,
the number of debug modules, or the maximum packet length.

Beside that it can be used to control the system. For that it can set
the soft reset of the processor cores and the peripherals separately in
the first specification.

Core Debug Module (CDM)
-----------------------

.. figure:: img/debug_module_cdm.*
   :alt: Core Debug Module
   :name: fig:debug_module_cdm

   Core Debug Module

The core debug module implements run-control debugging for a processor
core. The implementation is to a certain degree core-dependent, but a
generic implementation is sketched in @fig:debug\_module\_cdm. It has a
memory mapped interface as described above. The debug control, status
information and core register are mapped in memory regions. The
run-control debugger (e.g., gdb) then sends register access requests. In
case of a debug event (breakpoint hit) ``interrupt`` signals are
asserted. As a reaction the CDM reads a defined address and the
core-specific part of the CDM generates a debug event.

Of course, other implementations are possible or may be required
depending on the interface processor implementation.

Core Trace Module (CTM)
-----------------------

The *Core Trace Module (CTM)* captures trace events generated from the
processor core. The implementation is core-dependent and will be highly
configurable. Such trace events are core-internal signals, like the
completion of an instruction, the branch predictor status, memory access
delays, cache miss rates, just to name a few possibilities.

The CTM specification will define a few basic trace events and how they
can efficiently packed, because such events are usually generated with a
high rate.

Software Trace Module (STM)
---------------------------

The *Software Trace Module (STM)* emits trace events that are emitted by
the software execution. Such an STM event is a tuple ``(id,value)``.
There are generally two classed: user-defined and system-generated trace
events.

User-defined trace events are added by the user by instrumenting the
source code with calls to an API like
``TRACE(short id, uint64_t value)``. A debug tool can map the trace
events to a visualization.

Different user threads can emit trace events interleaved. Beside this
the operating system can emit relevant trace information too. For both
reasons, there are system-generated events.

There are two ways to emit a software trace event. First there is a set
of *special purpose registers* or similar techniques used to emit trace
events. Most importantly, each trace event must be emitted atomically.
Secondly, the processor core can have hardware to emit software trace
events. For example a mode change can be emitted without much overhead.

The generic trace interface is ``enable``, ``id`` and ``value`` at the
core level and the STM handles the filtering, aggregation and
packetization as described above.

Debug Processor Module (DPM)
----------------------------

.. figure:: img/debug_module_dpm.*
   :alt: Debug Processor Module
   :name: fig:debug_module_dpm

   Debug Processor Module

As mentioned in the `Introduction <#introduction>`__ we believe in the
importance of on-chip processing of debug information. The chip
interface is the bottleneck in the entire debug infrastructure. But the
developer wants to collect as much trace events as possible to get a
complete picture of the execution. The approach to solve this trade-off
is to process trace events on the chip already. This can be either
filtering or compression as introduced with `Trace
Modules <#trace-modules>`__, but also more complex processing of trace
events to generate processed information out of raw data.

A debug processor module is a subsystem in the debug system that can
receive debug packets, store them and process them to new debug packets
to be sent to the host. As depicted in @fig:debug\_module\_dpm a basic
DPM therefore contain a programmable hardware block (possibly a simple
CPU) and some local memory to execute programs from and store debug
data. A DPM can also send debug packets to configure debug modules and
set itself as destination of packets or configure filters, etc.

This subsystem may be interface from the system itself to configure it.
It may also be part of the actual system, like a core that can be
dynamically dedicated to be a DPM.

Device Emulation Module (DEM)
-----------------------------

It may be desired to deploy I/O modules that do not map to I/O pins, but
instead exchange transactions with the host. This may for example be a
serial terminal that send output characters to the host. Another
important use case for such modules is the emulation of devices on the
host or the simulation of a module during development of it.
